We would like to develop a relatively complete and mature system of transferrable action-abstractions from the ground up where as much is learned as possible. 

To do so, we introduce the action mode framework.

An action mode is a triple of 
1. mode support: a support of states on which the mode is defined
2. mode actions: a bounded, n-dimensional action space
3. projection: a function taking the mode actions to a base action space

To solve a problem with a collection of M completely defined action modes, you follow a four step process: 

1. take the state s you are in, and restrict your attention to the k supported modes for which s is in their mode support.
2. select a mode (let's call it mode i) from the k supported options.
3. select a latent action-within-mode z_i from the ith mode actions.
4. project z_i to a base action a, using the ith projection function. 
5. take action a in the base space, and repeat! 

Given that the mode supports and projection functions are completely packaged together with the modes, the only part left is to solve 2-3, which can essentially be solved via masking (using the supports) your favorite PAMDP solver. 

So now that we know how to use modes, that's great! But how did we get these projection functions and support sets to begin with? I'm glad you asked! 

There may be many ways to get all kinds of different modes, but not all of the modes you end up with are going to be particularly useful. Right now, in order to learn modes, our current thinking is that it suffices to learn parameterized skills which solve average reward tasks on a restriction of the state space and a low-dimensional compression of the action space. These skills will become our projection functions. There will be some special auxillary losses which help these skills become useful.

The mode actions then become interpretable as saying "if I execute this mode, and this particular mode action, I will eventually settle in the high-dimensional base space, into a pattern of behavior which is high reward under this task. For instance, walking forwards, or rotating, etc. 

## Training checkpoints

Within-run checkpoint retention is configured independently from end-of-trial
model saving:

```json
{
  "checkpoint_every": 100000,
  "save_strat": ["best", "latest"],
  "checkpoint_best_window": 100,
  "save_trials": "none"
}
```

`save_strat` accepts `all`, `best`, and `latest`, either as one string or as a
list. `all` keeps the existing step-numbered checkpoints. `latest` continually
replaces one alias and is also updated after a clean training completion.
`best` replaces one alias when the rolling mean completed-episode return
improves. A partial initial window is allowed. `last` is accepted as an alias
for `latest`; `none` must be used alone. If `save_strat` is omitted, a positive
`checkpoint_every` retains the backwards-compatible `all` behavior. Set
`checkpoint_every` to `null` to disable within-run checkpointing.

`save_trials` remains a separate policy for final models across trials.
Checkpoint files are model snapshots and do not universally contain replay or
environment state for full training resume.

The compact AMBI branch-count and imagination-horizon suite lives under
`configs/ambi/`. Each of its five algorithm files has one matching runnable
manifest under `configs/ambi/experiments/`; the anchor entry point is
`configs/ambi/experiments/ambi_anchor.json`, used with
`--alg-dir configs/ambi/algs`.

## Rendering a checkpoint

Use the dedicated renderer instead of `init.py`:

```bash
python render_checkpoint.py /path/to/checkpoint --display
python render_checkpoint.py /path/to/checkpoint --video-dir videos
python render_checkpoint.py /path/to/checkpoint --results-json evaluation.json
```

The renderer runs one complete deterministic episode by default. Use
`--episodes`, `--seed`, `--device`, `--max-steps`, or `--stochastic` to change
the rollout. Video mode writes one MP4 per episode and refuses to replace an
existing output unless `--overwrite` is supplied.

`--results-json` runs without a rendering backend and atomically writes strict
JSON. For the AMBI comparison protocol, evaluate the two aliases separately:

```bash
python render_checkpoint.py /path/to/model_best \
  --results-json evaluation/best.json --episodes 5 --seed 101
python render_checkpoint.py /path/to/model_latest \
  --results-json evaluation/latest.json --episodes 5 --seed 101
```

These commands use deterministic policy means and environment seeds 101–105.
The JSON includes the checkpoint identity, per-episode returns and lengths,
summary statistics, and resolved runtime metadata.

New checkpoints include an adjacent `.metadata.json` file containing the exact
environment, wrapper, and algorithm settings. Existing checkpoints in their
original `logs/<run>/models` directory are supported through the run's
`settings.json` and per-trial `alg_settings.json`. For copied legacy files, pass
`--trial-settings` and `--experiment-settings` explicitly.
